Horse because of huffs icon

Mr Derby is incredibly good at placing his bets on horses.
Eerily good.
"By chance" you happen to glance over on his betting card.
It doesn't look similar to any of the other players cards.
Is there some secret code for Mr Derby that tells him who to bet on..?

Solution here is to reverse the string made by doing
huffc myfile.huff --bytecode
